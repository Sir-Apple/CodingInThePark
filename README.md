# Coding In The Park

## Summary
CodingInThePark is a children-friendly Website with a simple look and animated CSS.

Quick website demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwkRM8pl0HM .

The website is built with the purpose is to let young children to learn about STEM and coding with several outdoor activities, which includes The Puzzle Game, City Hunt, Pictures Observation Game, Programmer Says Game, Fishing Game and The Logic Maze.

The website contains interactive functions including hover as well as mini puzzles and activities.

## Activities breakdown
### Puzzle Game

The puzzle game is intended to teach young children how a Python coding language turtle works. Python turtle graphics can be considered as a feature to let users to draw programmatically. Or it can be clearly described that it is a function that let the computer draws an image automatically by after received directional commands (Forward, Left, Right and Backward).|

#### Description
The chosen Puzzle Game is the Sliding Puzzle Game, demonstration video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKVkmfYukz8

The Sliding Puzzle Game used in this website:
image-puzzle-js
Image Puzzle game in pure JavaScript.

### Pictures Observation Game
Which can be called in a short-term as Pictures Game. This activity is designed to teach young children to learn how to debug by identifying erroneous code by seeing it as out of place. This is taught by using association and done by using spot the differences and spot the strange points. 

#### Description
There are 3 types:
1. Spotting strange points game: This game will provide several images which are already edited by photoshop (or other applications) and contain 1-2 strange spots for each image. Young code learners are asked to find a strange or weird point in a given image in each stage.
2. Spotting differences game (casual pictures): Spotting the differences between 2 images (which are same images but 1 of them is edited to become slightly different to the remaining one).
3. Spotting differences game (codes screenshots): Spotting the differences between 2 screenshots of set of codes (which are the same set of codes but 1 of them is edited).

General goal: This will help the kids to learn the basics of spotting bugs among the codes whether there are strange or weird parts of their coding. If there are strange spots in the image, means there will be a bug among the codes, and if not, the codes have no bug.  

Preparation: A certain number of perfect images or edited images which contain strange points. 

### Fishing Game
This activity is designed to teach participants how to use loops through the activity itself as an example. The game-like nature of this activity will help them learn ‘for’ loops through turn order, ‘while’ loops as each game is a single while loop, and ‘if’ statements through their success or failure to capture a fish. Using these simple concepts to demonstrate loops will make it easier for participants to learn them while having fun in the process.

What is a loop? 
A loop is, in essence, a circle. An example of this is a clock, which starts at 12 o’clock at the top and goes around until it reaches 12 o’clock again and again. This is an example of a loop. 

#### Description
The Activity:  
1. Choose how many people are doing the activity  
2. The game starts  
3. Player X tries to capture one of the fishable items  
4. Writes down if they caught it  
5. Cycle though the players repeating steps 3 and 4 till there are no fishable 
items left  
6. Announce the scores

Required components:  
This activity requires:  
1. A pool of water  
2. A set of rods and fishable items  
3. A set of score cards and writing utensils

Set up:  
1. First get or set up a pool of water  
2. Place the fishable item within the pool of water  
3. Get rods and score cards.

### City Hunt
This activity is designed to teach young children to learn the concept of Linked List from map reading skills, encryption and decryption.

#### Description
A cityhunt is a outdoor game in which the organizers prepare a list defining specific items, which the participants seek to gather the items or complete the tasks on the list. Usually participants work in small teams. The goal is to finish a list of clues and find the finish as fast as possible. A cityhunt is distinguished from a treasure hunt, in that the  latter involves one or a few items that are desirable and completed in sequence, while a cityhunt primarily collects undesirable or useless objects in random order. 

Prepare work: Set certain location, hide the location with simple encryption(QR code puzzle, Morse code, letter switch, search the location by a photo).   

### Programmer Says (If_Then_)
This activity has 2 names which can be either call ‘Programmer Says’ Game or ‘If_Then_’ Game. The activity is made to teach the participants to learn the "If...Then..." which is one of the basic statement of coding.

#### Description
The rules are similar to The 'Simon Says' Game. For each game begin, One child will play the programmer and the other child will play the computers, the programmer will order to all computers “If I ____ (fill in the blank), then you _____ (fill in the blank)”. For example, the Programmer below gave the command “If I turn in a circle, Then you turn in a circle.”  

What is If…Then… statement? 

In brief explanation, If..then is basic statement for coding, the program queries if there is a condition and then instructs it to perform certain operations. It can be as basic as a true or false question and answer, or it can prompt for action.

Type of Programmer says (or If…Then…) game  

For this activity, multiple children are required to play together. Each round of the game will have different children to play the programmer (the one who gives orders). The difference in difficulty level will depend on the age of the children participating in the game (generally 3-8 years old).  

### Logic Maze
This exercise uses association, repetition and familiarisation to teach the learners how to identify and navigate logic gates (except for the “or” type logic gate) in addition to reinforcing teamwork practices.  



#### Description
A teamwork maze that uses logic gate puzzles on gates to allow the players to continue in the maze (note that the gates literally have the symbol of the logic gate they represent on them). Teams will act as the input on a logic gate, deciphering clues within the gate’s room to solve the puzzle and continue through the maze. Clues may include things like a diagram or the name of the logic type.

What are logic gates?

Logic gates are electronic gates that respond or open to certain triggers. For example, a lightbulb can be turned on or off by pushing a switch up or down. Though this is a simple logic puzzle, it is still a good example of how they work. The most basic logic gates are:

    AND
    NOT
    OR

NOT gates work when the switch is off, AND gates work when all connected circuits are on, and OR gates work when at least one connected circuit is on. Using the lightbulb as an example again, when it is switched off, it is using the NOT gate, and when it is on, it is using either the AND or OR gate.

Setup required  
• This will require the creation of question/ puzzles involving logic gates  
• A large area/ building  
• Construction of the maze 

Game run through  
1. A team of 2(can be more but 2 is optimal) navigate the maze.  
2. The team enter a gate room, there are clues as to the gate’s nature.  
3. The team uses or does not use the switches in the room to solve the gate puzzle  
4. Once the gate is opened, they proceed on in the maze  
5. Repeat 1-4 till finished
