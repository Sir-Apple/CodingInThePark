## Activities breakdown
### Puzzle Game

The puzzle game is intended to teach young children how a Python coding language turtle works. Python turtle graphics can be considered as a feature to let users to draw programmatically. Or it can be clearly described that it is a function that let the computer draws an image automatically by after received directional commands (Forward, Left, Right and Backward).|

The chosen Puzzle Game is the Sliding Puzzle Game, demonstration video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKVkmfYukz8

The Sliding Puzzle Game used in this website:
image-puzzle-js
Image Puzzle game in pure JavaScript.

### Pictures Observation Game
Which can be called in a short-term as Pictures Game. This activity is designed to teach young children to learn how to debug by identifying erroneous code by seeing it as out of place. This is taught by using association and done by using spot the differences and spot the strange points. 

There are 3 types:
1. Spotting strange points game: This game will provide several images which are already edited by photoshop (or other applications) and contain 1-2 strange spots for each image. Young code learners are asked to find a strange or weird point in a given image in each stage.
2. Spotting differences game (casual pictures): Spotting the differences between 2 images (which are same images but 1 of them is edited to become slightly different to the remaining one).
3. Spotting differences game (codes screenshots): Spotting the differences between 2 screenshots of set of codes (which are the same set of codes but 1 of them is edited).

General goal: This will help the kids to learn the basics of spotting bugs among the codes whether there are strange or weird parts of their coding. If there are strange spots in the image, means there will be a bug among the codes, and if not, the codes have no bug.  

Preparation: A certain number of perfect images or edited images which contain strange points.
